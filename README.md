## üîç How It Works

### ‚úÖ Logic & Workflow

1. **Scraper Initialization**:
   - Connects to the **SEC EDGAR database** to fetch **recent filings** for NVIDIA.
2. **Filings Extraction**:

   - Identifies filings of interest (**13F-HR, 8-K, SC 13D, SC 13G, 10-Q, 10-K**).
   - Extracts filing type, date, and direct SEC link.

3. **Comparison with Previous Data**:

   - Compares new filings with **previously recorded filings (CSV)**.
   - Detects **new investment positions, stake changes, or exits**.

4. **Email Notifications**:

   - Sends an **email alert** with a **summary of new filings**.

5. **Scheduling & Automation**:

   - Runs **hourly** for high-priority filings.
   - Checks **4 times a day** for peak SEC filing times.
   - Runs **4 times a day** for long-term financial reports.

6. **Manual Trigger (On-Demand Scraping)**:
   - Provides a **`/run-scraper` API** for instant SEC filing updates.
